    - title: '<b>Q1: </b><u>How would you introduce yourself?</u>'
      items: 
        - '<b>A1:</b> I come from a small city in the middle of China, and like many children who love science fiction, I have had an endless interest in cosmic machinery since I was a child. When I was about to graduate from high school and faced the first choice in my life, I hoped to become an astronomer, to maximize my understanding of the universe in which I exist during my lifetime, and to be at the forefront of exploration. Unfortunately, my college entrance examination score was a bit short of universities that offer astronomy majors, but it does not matter, I can still choose other majors and try to get as close to it as possible. (That is why I chose NUAA), making robots also sounds cool, and someday the space explorer may have my contribution. <br>During university, my chosen major allowed me to dabble in all directions related to robots, from structural design (engineering drawing, mechanics) to system simulation (control theory), from circuit principles (Digital and Analog circuit) to embedded circuit (PCB design, embedded circuit), from microcomputer principles to C/C++. I participated in some interesting projects and chose SLAM as the direction of my graduation design in my senior year. As a graduate student, I was fortunate to enter the underwater robot laboratory, where I could continue to explore the direction of multi-sensor fusion positioning around robots. I got a lot of opportunities to practice knowledge in practice. <br>Because I have always adhered to the concept of learning for use, I joined a company related to lidar after graduation to engage in algorithm research and development related to autonomous driving, hoping to combine the learning in school with actual application here. In the more than one year since I joined the company, I think my personal ability has greatly improved compared to the school period, and I can independently propose solutions to the corresponding needs and problems and implement them in engineering.
I really like the passion of a start-up company and the flat management of the team I belong to. It is an unforgettable memory to brainstorm and sweat with my peers here. However, for some reasons, I feel it is time to take a step forward. <br>First of all, I want to continue to delve into the SLAM algorithm direction of multi-sensor fusion. In this general direction, there are almost no colleagues in the team who can give me relevant guidance or discuss related issues together; secondly, personal learning and improvement are subject to project progress requirements and development needs, which makes it difficult for people to invest too much energy and time to explore new ideas and innovate; I deeply feel that my knowledge reserve and ability are far from enough, I have a strong desire for knowledge, I hope to have time and energy to learn new knowledge, and at the same time, I do not want to be just a knowledge porter, but can freely explore and realize my own inspiration, and be at the forefront of the field. Finally, it is difficult to ensure the balance of work and life. I am willing to invest time in what should be done, but I also want to have the energy to develop other hobbies, rather than live for work. <br>I often look back and examine myself. I think my biggest advantage is that I will devote myself wholeheartedly to the things I decide to do. At the same time, my little cleverness allows me to draw inferences from one another in different fields and quickly get started with new fields and problems. The biggest disadvantage is that I am not decisive enough, I often like to plan and then move, and I hesitate to make a decision when I consider too much. <br>In life, I am a sincere person, I hope to treat others with sincerity, and others can also treat others with sincerity. Football is my favourite sport. I am a Liverpool fan. This club sometimes resonates with me. As a working-class team, without a lot of money, it realizes its dreams through passion and sweat. Cycling is my new hobby, I enjoy the freedom and speed of cycling. I like rock and roll and reading, and when I have nothing to do, I will play my favourite songs with an electric guitar, but I am still noob hahaha.'

    - title: '<b>Q2: </b><u>Why do I want to be a PhD?</u>'
      items: 
        - '<b>A2:</b> The idea of becoming a PhD does not come out of nowhere. <br>First and foremost, **Deepening knowledge**. I feel that the knowledge I had was still lack for what I want to do. I am eager to acquire advanced research skills, delve deeper into my chosen subject and contribute to its advancement.<br>Furthermore, **Intellectual curiosity**. I would consider myself a person driven by a curiosity to explore and uncover new knowledge in the field I am interested in. I found robotics interesting, and I wanted to put my energy into it, rather than doing some other easy but boring job for living.<br>Additionally, **Personal development.** I view pursuing a PhD as an opportunity for personal growth and challenge to myself. Cannot get into comfort zone at this age.<br>Lastly, I want to do something meaningful and make my life fulfilled.'

    - title: '<b>Q3: </b><u>Why do I think I am qualified for a PhD?</u>'
      items: 
        - '<b>A3:</b> As a PhD candidate, I believe I am qualified for a doctoral program due to the following reasons: <br>1. <b>Academic related:</b> Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated strong academic performance. Meanwhile, I systematically learned a lot of knowledge related to robotics, which enables me to look at problems from a holistic perspective. I keep reading the literature to keep up with the latest trends and critically analysing existing literature, identifying limitations, and apply to the problems encountered. These skills are crucial for conducting independent research at the doctoral level.<br>2. <b>Experience and Problem-Solving Skills:</b> I have actively engaged in research, science projects and experiments throughout my academic career and work, either as part of coursework or independently. Most tend towards application, so although there is no paper published, but I think there is a strong ability. And have already invested in my academic interest(SLAM) in many years of effort(in study and work). <br>3. <b>Motivation and Perseverance</b>: I am highly motivated to contribute to the knowledge base of my interest field and hate I have smattering of knowledge. I am prepared to invest the time and effort necessary to complete a rigorous doctoral program. I have demonstrated resilience in the face of challenges and setbacks, whether it is in arduous sea trials or intense work.  and I am committed to seeing my research through to completion. <br>4. <b>Communication and Collaboration Skills</b>: I have honed my communication skills through presentations, academic writing, and engaging in discussions with peers. I am adept at conveying complex ideas clearly and concisely. Additionally, I value collaboration and have experience working in interdisciplinary teams, which will enable me to effectively collaborate with other researchers and professionals in my field.'
