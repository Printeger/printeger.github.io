# 3. Solve AX = XB

The function performs the Hand-Eye calibration using various methods. 

- [ ] One approach consists in estimating the rotation then the translation (separable solutions).

- [ ] Separable solutions solving separately damages the integrity of the kinematics problem and leads to coupling errors in the calculation of rotation and translation.

> R. Horaud, F. Dornaika Hand-Eye Calibration

- [ ] Another approach consists in estimating simultaneously the rotation and the translation (simultaneous solutions).

- [ ] Simultaneous solutions handle rotation and translation simultaneously and describes pose transformation in a unified manner, reducing complexity and improving calibration accuracy.

In this program, we use K. Daniilidis's Dual Quaternions method to solve AX=XB problem.

    point b to point a :

    use quaternion:  pa = q * pb * q̄

    A line in space with direction la through a point pa to a line in space with direction lb through a point pb: 

    la = q * lb * q̄
